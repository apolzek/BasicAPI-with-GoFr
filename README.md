# üí° Library Management System

This is a simple and user-friendly REST API for managing a library's book collection. The API provides endpoints to perform various operations, such as retrieving all books, fetching a particular book by ISBN or author, updating existing book information, creating new books, and deleting books from the library. Implemented in Go with GoFr framework and MongoDB, the system showcases CRUD operations, and seamless database integration.

# Database üõ¢Ô∏è

The project utilizes a MongoDB database to store books. For MongoDB you can use both Atlas or Compass

# For Atlas

Go to website, make a cluster and set up a database, then copy the Database link. Then go to mongo folder and there in mongo.go file paste the link in connectionString and fillUP the dbName and collectionName.

# For Compass

First install Compass make a database and collection and remember the name, Then install mongosh, if it is already then run it in terminal by typing

```bash
mongosh
```
